I am thrilled to do these Commands in the fullstack Dev Coding:



npm run dev:server			- To run the node server

npx tsnd src/dev/load-test-data.ts	- To run and import test data in to the mongoDB server

docker-compose up			- To run mongoDB from docker

npm run dev:bundler    			- To build and run the bundle
